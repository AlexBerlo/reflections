What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository git will track changes to the directory you created it in, exactly the reason for which you would want to do it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an intermediate place between the working directory and the repository where you can choose what gets commited or not. The values it offers is more control for the developer to organize his files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding only the modified files by that logical change, from the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When are you adding new / experimental features to the project but want to keep the old one intact. Branches would help by making it easier to navigate from one branch to another instead of just navigating through commits in the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Shows where the branches start and what new features have been added to each branch ( through commit history). Very useful when you have to merge.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is incorporating the changes of the auxiliary branch into the master branch. The representation is accurate since that is how the history would look for a file with multiple branches.
